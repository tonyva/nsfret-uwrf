Bioinformatics project for the 2025 Summer RET

First things first, it is essential that we familiarize ourselves with the tools needed to perform bioinformatics analysis. Our main programming language will be Python 

While there is a lot we can do with a system running the Windows operating system, when doing research, it is best to use a system running the Linux operating system.

Therefore, we will take a look at using Linux and the Python programming language. A good way to do this would be to use a Virtual Machine running the Linux operating system. 
The reason for this is that we will use open source bioinformatics tools and Linux is probably the best platform for installing and using bioinformatics tools.

If you have a laptop or a desktop computer running Linux (natively on the host computer), you are all set! 
Otherwise, if you have a Windows 11 system, there are a couple of options:
1. Use the Windows Sybsten for Linux feature of Windows. We can think of this as a small Linux machine inside your Windows machine. 
   Not everything works in WSL and so another option is to use the next option
2. Install virtualization software like VirtualBox. This is a free product from Oracle 

If you have a laptop or desktop computer running Apple's macOS, you could just use the native macOS environment but 
you may still want to install virtualization software like VirtualBox (free from Oracle).
