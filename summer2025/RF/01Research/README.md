# Research papers discussed:
1. Haplotype-resolved genome assembly ... https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-024-01820-x  Nature Plants 2024 Zhang et. al.

## Rationale
1. The main rationale for discussing papers is to get that research experience
   of "doing research" by getting up to speed on what research has already
   been done.
2. See what research "tools" are in use now.
3. See what we need to learn as far as concepts, computational techniques, 
   and how the data is obtained.
4. Once we do these, we can get a handle on what the hypotheses are - often,
   these hypotheses are very good but hard to see because of jargon!
5. Make sure there is good data to support the validity of hypotheses

## Process
1. Read the paper - 30 minutes or more a day
2. Make a list of each word you are not very sure of - 5-10 minutes a day
3. Ask another researcher or "expert"
4. Compile a glossary for the day
5. Compile a list of hypotheses uncovered
6. See if you can figure out what evidence/data will be needed to validate
   each hypothesis.
7. Repeat until you have covered the entire paper
8. Repeat 1-7 until you see nothing new in the paper
