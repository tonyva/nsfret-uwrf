## Genome Variation Map

-    Genome resequencing of 215 Rosa accessions, plus 18 publicly available, for a total of 233.\
-    Samples included wild species, intermediate old cultivars, and modern cultivars.\
-    Sections represented: Chinenses, Rosa, Synstylae, Cinnamomeae, Caninae, and other sections (Pimpinellifoliae, Microphyllae, Banksianae, Bracteatae, Laevigatae).\
-    17,567,247 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified.\
-    SNP locations: 41.54% in intergenic regions, 21.84% in intron regions, 10.92% in coding regions.\
-    Coding region SNPs: 52.13% non-synonymous, 46.60% synonymous.\
-    Nucleotide diversity (ππ): Ranged from 1.42×10−31.42×10−3 to 4.11×10−34.11×10−3 in wild species sections. Intermediate old cultivars showed highest diversity (5.24×10−35.24×10−3). Modern cultivars diversity was 4.79×10−34.79×10−3.\

## Origin of Modern Rose

-    Phylogenetic analysis indicates major contributions from sections Chinenses and Synstylae.\
-    Principal component analysis (PCA) separated Cinnamomeae and other sections from modern cultivars.\
-    Population structure analysis (ADMIXTURE) revealed seven optimal populations (K = 7).\
-    At K = 7, R. chinensis and R. odorata were clearly divided into two groups.\
-    'Hume’s Blush Tea-scented China' (derived from R. odorata) contributed more to modern cultivars than R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’.\
-    Cultivars with larger genetic contributions from section Synstylae are often classified as Floribunda.\
-    Six potential original species clarified: R. chinensis, R. wichuraiana, R. gallica, R. fedtschenkoana, R. odorata, and R. moschata.\

## Genomic Composition of R. hybrida ‘Samantha’

-    Genomic origins inferred based on read depth and variant frequency of original wild species.\
-    Largest proportion derived from R. odorata var. gigantea (18.25%).\
-    Contributions from R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’ (17.51%), R. wichuraiana (13.47%), R. gallica (11.80%), R. moschata (10.79%), and R. fedtschenkoana (7.73%).\
-    Chromosomes exhibited high degree of chimaerism, with each derived from multiple ancestral species.\
-    Chr7B was derived from R. fedtschenkoana and was shorter, lacking homoeologous exchanges.\
-    Large inversion observed on chromosome 7.\

## Artificial Selection During Modern Rose Breeding

-    Selective sweep analysis compared modern cultivars (bred after 1867; n = 32) and intermediate old cultivars (bred before 1867; n = 45).\
-    Tetraploid intermediate old cultivars (Int_4) and tetraploid modern cultivars (Hyb_4) were used.\
-    Int_4 had higher nucleotide diversity (π=5.39×10−3π=5.39×10−3) than Hyb_4 (π=4.83×10−3π=4.83×10−3).\
-    Int_4 exhibited faster linkage disequilibrium decay than Hyb_4.\
-    Selective sweep regions identified (44.42 Mb total), containing 3,382 genes.\
-    Genes related to continuous flowering, flower meristem development, flower color, senescence, disease resistance, and prickle formation were revealed.\
-    KSN genes (Rh3AG182500, Rh3BG208800) found in selective sweep region, contributing to continuous flowering.\
-    Genes encoding regulators involved in vernalization (VIL1, VIP, FRL, RTV1) and photoperiod pathway (NFL, LATE) were selected.\
-    Flower meristem identity genes SPL4, CLV1, BAM1, and LMI1 were selected.\
-    AP2 genes (Rh2AG184600, Rh2BG195000) were under selection, influencing petal number.\
-    GT5 involved in floral pigment biosynthesis was also identified in selective sweep regions.\
-    Ethylene-related genes (ACOs, CTR1, EIN2, ERFs) were found in selected regions, influencing flower opening and senescence.\
-    CTR1 (Rh3BG199500), a key component of the ethylene signal transduction pathway, has been under selection.\
-    ROS1 (Rh3BG199400), encoding a DNA demethylase, was also found in this selective sweep region.\
-    Genes encoding enzymes related to lignin biosynthesis and cell wall modification (XTH, LAC, PER, PME) were found in selective sweep regions.\
-    Disease resistance genes homologous to Arabidopsis NCA1, RPW8, and rose MLO gene were identified.\
-    Plant NB-LRR immune receptors (14 TNL and 12 CNL) were identified in selective sweep regions.\
-    LOG gene, regulating prickle formation, was identified in selective sweep regions.\
-    OOMT1 gene (Rh2AG330600), related to tea-scent, was identified. SNP (Chr2A:47717127) in this gene determines tea-scent trait.\

## Discussion

-    The study provides a haplotype-resolved genome assembly of tetraploid modern rose ‘Samantha’ and a comprehensive genome variation map.\
-    Chinese and European old cultivars originated from reticulate evolution among several wild species within Rosa.\
-    R. odorata, in addition to R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’, played an important role as the Chinese progenitor of modern rose.\
-    Wild species in section Synstylae have played important roles in the formation of modern rose, particularly the Floribunda type with clustered flowers.\
-    Cultivation and domestication of old cultivars in China and Europe have accumulated a substantial number of ideal agronomic traits.\
-    Selective sweep analysis identified genome regions under selection during modern rose breeding.\
-    Continuous and recurrent flowering is a core trait of modern rose cultivars, and therefore selection of related genes is expected.\
-    Modern roses have been selected for low sensitivity to ethylene to delay senescence.\
-    Transposon insertion in the AP2L gene causes variation in its coding region, which makes it resistant to miRNA172 cleavage, promoting the double flower phenotype. Moreover, transposon insertion in the KSN gene restricts its expression, leading to the continuous and recurrent flowering trait of modern roses.\
