1. Interspecific hybrid:
    result of crossing 2 species within a genus
    Classification of living things: ... Family, Genus, Species

2. haplotype:
    a set of DNA variations inherited together
    e.g. genes on a single chromosome

3. haplotype-resolved genome:
    genomes with variations within chromosome copies
    e.g. variation between genes from different parents

4. Homologous chromosomes:
    duplicate/similar chromosomes
    e.g. each one of a pair of chromosomes in a diploid genome

5. Homeologous exchanges:
    exchanges of genetic material between non-identical chromosomes from a common ancestor

6. Selective sweeps:
    rapid spread of a (beneficial) mutation through a population resulting in lower genetic variation in that population

7. reticulate evolution:
    emergence of a new lineage through merging of ancestor lineages resulting a phylogenetic Network rather than a tree

8. ploidy level:
    number of sets of chromosomes in a cell/genome
    e.g. humans are diploid - ploidy is 2

9. inflorescence type:
    flower shapes - can be definite or indefinite, etc.

10. LTR-RT:
    Long Terminal Repeat RetroTransposons
    => DNA sequences that repeat and can be used to characterize a genome.
       These sequences "move" around in a genome by:
       a. being transcribed to RNA
       b. reverse transcripted from RNA to DNA
       c. the DNA being inserted into a new location in the genome
       --> such movements promote chromosomal rearrangements
           and are markers of genome evolution
    e.g. classic case of Barbara McClintock's discovery of "jumping" genes in corn
         In corn (maize), 85% of the genome is made of Transposons or transposable elements, of which, 75% is LTR-RT

11. Types of LTR-RTs:
    LTR-RTs are classified into Gypsy and Copia superfamilies
    

12. Synteny:
    (old) genes occurring together on a chromosome
    (new) conservation of blocks of genes within two sets of chromosomes => "syntenic blocks"

13. Phenotype:
    Set of observable traits of an organism

14. Phenotypic variation:
    variabilities that can be observed in individuals of a species

15. Phenology:
    seasonal changes in plants or animals

16. Phenological Adaptation:
    ability of organisms to adjust timing of seasonal responses
    e.g. flowering, hibernation

17. Cultivar: 
    a cultivated variety (of a plant) selected for specific desirable traits
    - usually maintained through propagation methods like:
      a. root or stem cuttings
      b. grafting
      c. tissue culture
      d. seed production
      e. offset - small plant (clone) produced asexually from a parent

18. Heterozygosity:
    having two or more forms of a gene, i.e. alleles
    in an organism's genetic makeup

19. haploid:
    a single set of unpaired chromosomes
    e.g. in a germ cell (egg/sperm)
    
20. doubled haploid:
    a genotype resulting from chromosome doubling
    i.e. two copies of each chromosomes used to produce homozygous lines from a heterozygous individual in plant breeding
    
21. tetraploid:
    Four copies of each chromosome
    i.e. ploidy is 4
    
=======================================
Note on Rose tetraploid genome size:
   The number of (single strand) DNA bases in 4 sets (ploidy) of chromosomes x 7 chromosomes is 2 billion bases (2Gb)
   => each set of 7 chromosomes will have 2/4 => 0.5 Gb

cf. Humans have 3 Gb
=======================================

Note of the number of "reads" i.e. "short" sequences
- 103 Gb of PacBio HiFi
- 237 Gb of Oxford Nanopore
- 140 Gb of MGI paired-end reads
- 543 Gb of HiC conformation capture -> detects shape of chromatins (DNA + protein complex in chromosomes) by combining
                                  Chromosome Conformation (shape) and Capture (3C)
                                  Tells us the frequency with which 2 DNA fragments physically associate in three dimensions
-  43 Gb of Pore-C data -> 3C plus Ox Nano to look at chromatin structure
